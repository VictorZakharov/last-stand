// The hall of heroes: the hero selection screen's stage (ui/heroSelect.ts), in a room of its own shown in the biome's
// place (world/heroHall.ts). Every class's hero stands in a row on a plinth in his gear from the save slot in play, each a remote player's copy (its casts play for show, dealing nothing:
// net/role.ts `dealsDamage`), the lobby's own hero hidden meanwhile. The camera comes to the hero in focus, lit by a key
// light and a rim light from the pool (fx/lights.ts: the count never changes), and he shows off a skill of his as it
// arrives (`HallDef.showcase`). Every hero's programs are warm before it opens (game/warm.ts, the `heroes` need).
