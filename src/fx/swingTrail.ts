// The trail a swung weapon leaves: the band its striking part swept over the last tenth of a second, white, brightest
// along the path of its edge and fading behind it, so a strike's arc reads in every view. It follows the weapons a
// strike swings (`Model.swung`) in the hero's own frame (his model's root): through the eyes his arms are placed in the
// view and drawn by a camera of their own (`drawArms`), and the trail is drawn with them, on their layer, so it lies
// where the weapon is seen and a turn of the view carries it round with them. Only a weapon swung fast leaves one: a
// wind-up and a walk's swing of the arm leave none. Each frame's place of the weapon is a point of a curve through
// them (centripetal Catmull-Rom), cut into steps a few centimetres long, so a swing a frame crosses half a metre in
// stays round. Light adds up: added white, dimmed with distance (`nearGlow`), a thin edge over a faint band.
