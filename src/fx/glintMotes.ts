// Motes of light drawn in onto a drawn arrow's head once the bow is drawn to full (combat/skills/ranger.ts
// `drawGlint`), the sign the shot is at its strongest: specks spiralling in from round it and fading into the head,
// until it's loosed (shown as the bow was drawn, they didn't say when it was full). One quad faces
// the camera from the arrowhead (a child of the model's `arrowHead`, so it rides the arrow in every view) and its
// fragment shader places the motes, each with a short trail. Its reach is as far as the motes come from in the world,
// and never more than a share of the view's height: the world's particles fade within 3.5 m of the camera
// (fx/particles.ts), so through the eyes, the arrowhead under a metre off, nothing of them showed. Nothing gathers at
// the head itself: a star of light there read as a bright spark, and was too bright in every view.
