// The Mage: a battle scholar, lean and clean-shaven, his dark hair cropped short, in a fitted oxblood longcoat with a
// high standing collar, split up the front over a charcoal waistcoat, brass-edged, a leather harness
// buckled in brass; his shirt's charcoal sleeves pushed up over forearms inked with runes, a grimoire chained at his hip,
// tall worn boots, and a gnarled staff cradling a floating crystal. The longcoat with its collar, shoulders, harness and
// skirts is the chest item's, the bracers the hands item's: without them the waistcoat and bare forearms. Fully procedural.
