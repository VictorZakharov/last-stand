// squarely the surface faces each. Read where it lay as it was sculpted (its vertices' own places, before skinning),
// the grain stays on the skin as it bends. (Read flat along the one axis each vertex faced most, the glove's leather
// broke into streaks down the hand's sides wherever the axis changed.)
