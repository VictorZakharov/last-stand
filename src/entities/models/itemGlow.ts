// A worn item's glow in its rarity's colour (#404): a Rare item and better glows faintly over its own colour and the
// hero's dye, most at its edges, wisps drifting slowly up it and breathing (`ITEM_GLOW` in core/materials.ts). No
// light and no program of its own: a glowing item's parts draw with copies of their kit materials (`kitCopy`), the
// same program as every kit material's, their glow a uniform's colour of their own. Every material a hero draws in
// is a switch for three, which sends all of its uniforms again (13 to 24 us each on a desktop, a draw in the material
// before's 2 to 4). So where the hero's looks draw from palettes (`palette.ts`, WebGL) a copy is a row of its
// original's palette, and costs nothing; elsewhere (WebGPU, a part no palette holds) an item that doesn't glow
// (under Rare, or the setting off) draws in the kit's own materials.
