// Crowds: every creature of a kind drawn in one draw call a material (and one more each for its shadow), however
// many are about. A creature is a few meshes a joint (models/shapes.ts `Sculpt`), some 77 draw calls a body with its
// shadow, and a full wave was mostly draw calls (#222). So a kind's pieces are merged per material into one geometry
// skinned on its joints, and each body is an instance of it: its joints' matrices and its looks (the kit's dissolve,
// frost, char and hit flash, its edge's colour, how strongly each glow shines, whether it casts a shadow) are a row
// of a float texture the shaders read by `gl_InstanceID`. The bodies keep their own meshes on a layer the camera
// doesn't draw (`CROWD_LAYER`), for what reads them: an arrow lodges in them, the outline draws them.
// `?crowd=0` draws each body on its own again, for A/B.
