// A woodland archer in a fitted green trailcoat, leather bracers and boots, with a recurved bow (models/bow.ts). His shot
// is an archer's, every joint within a body's ranges (armIK.ts): the string taken with the bow brought in before the
// chest, then the bow up and the string back, side-on to the target with his head turned to it, the bow arm straight
// along the arrow's line and the string drawn to an anchor at the side of his jaw, the draw elbow round behind his head,
// so his draw length is what his own arms reach. Loosed, the draw hand follows through out from the neck and the bow
// tips forward in the loose fist; then the hand takes the next arrow from the quiver over his right shoulder and nocks
// it. Between shots he carries the bow in his fist at his side, an arrow nocked, his draw hand free; a fan of arrows is
// shot with the bow laid over flat, the arrows lying across its top.
