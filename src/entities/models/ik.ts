// Leg IK for the humanoid rig: feet that stay where they are put. The procedural walk cycle (rig.ts `walkCycle`) swings
// the legs as rotations, which slides every foot along the floor; this runs after the pose and takes the legs over:
// a planted foot is held at a spot in the world while the body moves over it, a swinging foot arcs from where it left
// to where it will land (ahead of the body, predicted from its speed), a standing character re-steps when its feet
// have fallen far from under it or it turns, the pelvis drops when a foot would be out of reach, and a foot lies level
// on the ground (`groundHeight`, so the dais steps work). Each leg is then solved as two-bone IK (`reachArm`, hinged
// the other way) and blended over the pose it replaces. The stride's timing still comes from the walk cycle's own
// phase (the arms swing by it too), which the gait rate keeps in step with the speed (`gaitRate`).
//
// A frame of `LegIK.update` goes: the body's lean and the pelvis's turn (`leanIntoMotion`, `turnPelvis`), its motion
// and the gait's timing (`followMotion`), each foot stepped (`stepFoot`: a stride started or carried on, a step
// taken, a planted foot tended, the ankle's target placed), the pelvis dropped until both feet are in reach
// (`dropPelvis`), and each leg solved onto its target (`solveLeg`). What the steps share is the frame's `GaitFrame`.
//
// `LookAt` turns the neck and head onto a point of interest, within limits.
