// The lamps' shadows drawn once (`core/lamps.ts` reads them): for each lamp in the list, six faces round it, the

// what stands round them never move, so it's drawn at boot, as the village is built, and never again: two lamps cast
// by the pool's casting lights, and lit by the list alone the rest lit through all that stood round them (from play,
// "your light test for each light need to test SHADOW, it was missing for half of them"). What's drawn is what casts
// as the world is built (the merged caster the shadow maps alone draw, the instanced posts and trunks); a leaf card,
// which casts by its picture's alpha, is left out (drawn whole, it would cast a square).
