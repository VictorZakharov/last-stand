// The village the lobby stands in (data/village.ts lays it out, world/villagePlan.ts makes its plan geometry, and
// game/village.ts makes its objects work): a green hamlet in a meadow, built once at boot beside the biomes and shown in
// their place between runs (`Arena`'s place). It's laid out as a hamlet grows: a palisade wandering round it, its roads
// winding from a cobbled square round a fountain, cottages each turned its own way with a footpath worn from its door,
// sheds, groves of trees inside and a wood round it, lamps along its roads. North, up a broad stair, a terrace where the
// hall of heroes stands, a building its door opens on the heroes' room (the stash's chest right of its door); the yard
// south-east, fenced, its dummies the only place skills are cast; a campfire, the chronicle's lectern across the door
// from the chest, a notice board. Its two ways out are places of their own beyond gaps in the palisade (world/villageWays.ts): the crypt's
// walled court and sunken door north-east, the Thornwood's grove south-west, each with its portal. Grass grows wherever
// nothing's built or trodden (world/meadow.ts, its mask painted from the plan). Its floor has levels (the terrace and
// the hall's dais: world/ground.ts's relief, and no arena's dais), reached by stairs alone: each ledge is faced by a wall a body is kept
// off (world/wall.ts outlines), so feet climb the steps one by one; its wall is what's built (`wallShape` 'free'). Its
// light follows the hour (`daylight`, a uniform's change: nothing compiles), and as a biome it has 10 point lights, two
// casting the still shadows (the hall's braziers).
