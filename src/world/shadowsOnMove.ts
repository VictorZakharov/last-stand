// Low's village draws what moves into the kept shadow maps only on frames it has moved (from play, an S25 Edge's
// Profile at full res: the shadow maps 8 ms of an 80 ms frame). The sun's map and the lamps' are kept as drawn still
// (`moonShadow.ts`, `lampShadows.ts`), and each frame they're copied back and the heroes, the yard's dummies and the
// chest's lid drawn over them: a hero standing, little of it changes. So where no part drawn has moved or turned by a
// step (`STEP`: each mesh's matrix, a skinned one's bones) since the frame that last drew them, the maps are left as
// that draw left them, and a still draw (the sun a step on, a lamp's light handed on, the props) has the next frame's
// draw again. A body's sway at rest under a step stays out of its shadow until it moves: a step of a centimetre, and
// the ranger's bow, quiver and head took the maps drawn again on 92 to 100% of the frames he stood (`lab village
// --only shadowsOnMove`: 3 cm, 2 to 8%). A quality switch, live.
