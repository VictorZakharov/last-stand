// A fire burning on a prop (a brazier's coals, a bonfire's logs): flames as a volume, a fluid simulated once
// (world/fireBake.ts) and played as a loop, each ray through a box over the bed gathering the light its burning gas gives
// and losing what's behind to it, as hot gas does (emission and absorption by one coefficient, after Fire Pro's,
// https://github.com/dgreenheck/threejs-fire-pro, MIT), coloured as a blackbody's heat, so they hold their shape as the
// camera goes round them (sheets turned to the camera turned with it); a bed of coal lumps glowing
// through cracks in their char; embers drifting up and smoke over it. One swell of the flames' height and the light's (a fire a metre across puffs about
// 1.5 times a second) moves them together. `tools/lab` `fire` measures it.
