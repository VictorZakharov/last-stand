// Lamps every lit surface is lit by, at any distance, as a renderer with clustered lights lights them (Unreal's
// forward shading lists the lights in a grid of cells and lights each pixel by its cell's): three's own point lights
// are as many as its programs were compiled for, and a light more compiles them all again, so the village's street
// lamps were lit by the pool's lights at the three nearest the hero alone, the rest drawn as painted pools that turned
// into lit ground as he walked up (from play: "I dont like when lights change from low quality to high quality when I
// come close, it looks lame"). These are a list in a uniform of three's own lit materials (`ShaderLib`), every lit
// shader's lights looping over it after three's point lights, by three's own falloff: the same light as a point light
// at that spot, and no light in the list changes a program. The list is one array of floats, shared by every material
// (three clones each material's uniforms from `ShaderLib`'s, vectors and arrays of them too, but keeps a typed array as
// it is), so a lamp set here is set for all.
//
// Each lamp casts the shadows of what stands still round it, from a map of them all drawn once (`world/lampAtlas.ts`:
// six faces a lamp, the distance to the nearest thing it meets in each texel, as a point light's cube holds it), as
// lamps and what stands round them never move: lit by the list alone, every lamp but the two nearest the hero, which
// cast by the pool's casting lights, lit through what stood round it (from play, "your light test for each light need
// to test SHADOW, it was missing for half of them"). Its light would still go through walls the map hasn't, so one
// box on the ground is a shelter (the hall of heroes' inside), and each lamp lights either what's inside it or what's
// outside (its torches lit the terrace through the hall's walls, and the street lamps its room; switched over at its
// door, the lamps went out as the hero walked in, "lights turn off when I enter the hall").
