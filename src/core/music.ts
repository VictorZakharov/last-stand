// Music: each biome's tracks (data/music.ts, `BiomeDef.music`), one in its lobby and between its runs' waves, and one
// through each wave's fight. Every track is fetched and decoded when it's first wanted, looped by a buffer source over
// its loop (seamless whatever delay a decoder leaves at the file's start: an audio element's own loop left a gap of the
// MP3's padding) and faded by a gain node of its own (iOS ignores an audio element's volume), through the sound
// effects' WebAudio context, so it starts with the first user gesture that resumes it. Two cross as the music changes:
// the one going fades out as the next fades in where it was left (a run's battle track on from wave to wave), from its
// top once it was let go (a new run's first wave, a biome switched to).
