// Hailfletch: arrows raining on the ground at the aim for as long as the key is held. The ranger stands his ground and
// shoots one arrow after another high over the spot, each posed as any shot (drawn, loosed, the next taken from the
// quiver); each one splits at the top of its flight into a shower of `missiles` arrows fanning out from there and
// coming down together on spots anywhere in the area, then the next arrow goes up. (Its sheaf spread over the next
// shot's time, the rain was a steady drizzle that read as nothing to do with the shots.) Each arrow strikes the foe it
// falls on, if any, for `damage`: a foe may take several or none (hit as a whole area, it didn't matter where they
// fell), and stays in it; one that comes down on a prop goes into its top (off it, if it's stone), the rest into the
// floor (off it on stone: fx/stuckArrows). The area follows the aim at a walk, and what's in the air when the key is let
// go still comes down.
