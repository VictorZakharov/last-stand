// stands (his body dissolving, its edges burning green), crosses to it as a streak of that light faster than anything
// can strike him, through whatever stands between, and is put together again there. Untouchable from the moment he
// comes apart until he starts to form again, and the foes round where he vanished are left dazed (`Enemy.daze`),
// standing there a moment while the rest come on. Every game shows it; his own game moves him and judges the daze, as
