// bonfire at 79 fps where the owner's phone drew 35 (a phone's GPU throws away its fast path on cut-out leaves and
// blending, a desktop's doesn't). So the game times itself: its frames are held (`holdFrames`), and the frame as it
// stands is drawn again and again with each part taken out and put back in turns (`sceneParts.ts`), each frame waited
// out on the GPU (WebGL: a pixel read back; WebGPU: its queue's work done) and timed by the page's clock. In turns, the
// device's heat and clocks fall on both sides alike. The result is shown, and sent with the player's consent as a
// performance report (`consent.ts` `sendProfile`), where `lab trace` reads it.
