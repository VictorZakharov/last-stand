// The parts of a frame's work the profiler (`profiler.ts`, timed on the player's own device) takes out and puts back,
// each without a program changing: the point lights' lighting where they reach, the shadow maps' drawing, the lit
// shading against a plain colour, what's cut out (leaves, grass: alpha tested) and what's blended, the particles, the
// fires' flames, the hero, his hands alone, and the scene drawn at half its pixels. Each is found in the scene as it
// stands, so the parts are those of the place the player stands in. The lab's `scenecost`
// (tools/lab/page/sceneCost.ts) keeps its own parts, some changing programs (a light hidden, a shadow or the
// environment taken off), compiled before it times: an A/B copies the lab's page modules into the other commit's
// tree, where this module isn't on a commit older than it.
