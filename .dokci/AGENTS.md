# `.dokci`

Dokci's project (`project.yaml`): it deploys the co-op relay (`server/relay`) on every push to `main`; the game itself is on GitHub Pages (`.github/AGENTS.md`).

The rules across the game are the [root AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Gotchas

- **Dokci relay TLS:** the production route in `.dokci/project.yaml` must explicitly set `entryPoint: websecure` and `certificateResolver: letsencrypt`. Omitting them creates an HTTP-only route even though the installed proxy redirects public HTTP to HTTPS; container health alone does not prove public TLS works. Keep the relay's internal HTTP port and health check unchanged, and verify trusted HTTPS at `/health` plus a WSS connection after the merged revision deploys. Never bypass certificate verification or add a public-relay fallback.
