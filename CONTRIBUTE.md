# Contributing

Contributions come in as pull requests from a fork: you open an issue, fix it on a branch of your fork, and open a PR into `main` of `VictorZakharov/last-stand`. Two scripts automate the routine parts: `scripts/issue.sh` and `scripts/commit.sh`.

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before changing code: it has the product rules (procedural everything, original names, UI that fits any screen) and the gotchas.

## 1. One-time setup

You need `git`, Node.js and the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

1. Log in to the GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
   With the browser login, it prints a one-time code in the terminal: open https://github.com/login/device and paste it there.
2. Fork the repo and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   gh repo fork VictorZakharov/last-stand --clone
   cd last-stand
   npm install
   ```
   This creates `<you>/last-stand` on GitHub and clones it with two remotes: `origin` (your fork, you push here) and `upstream` (`VictorZakharov/last-stand`, you open PRs against it).

   If you forked on github.com instead, clone your fork and add the remote yourself:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:VictorZakharov/last-stand.git
   ```
3. Check the remotes with `git remote -v`: both scripts rely on `origin` and `upstream`.

Keep your fork's `main` a mirror of upstream `main`: never commit to it. Work always happens on a branch.

## 2. Quick flow with the scripts

```bash
scripts/issue.sh     # open an issue, get a fix/issue-N branch and a prompt for Claude
# ...do the work, test it with npm run dev...
scripts/commit.sh    # build, commit, push to your fork, open the PR, print its link
```

### `scripts/issue.sh ["title" ["description"]]`

Prompts for whatever you don't pass (end the description with Ctrl-D), then:

1. checks that the working tree is clean
2. fast-forwards `main` to `upstream/main` and pushes it to your fork
3. creates the issue upstream
4. creates the branch `fix/issue-N` off `main`, where N is the new issue's number
5. prints a prompt for Claude to start on the issue (and copies it to the clipboard on macOS)

### `scripts/commit.sh`

Run it on an issue branch (its name ends in `issue-N`). It:

1. runs `npm run build` and `npm run check:pages`, and stops if either fails
2. asks for a title (the issue title by default) and, for a new PR, a description (end with Ctrl-D)
3. commits all changes, using the title as the message (skipped when nothing is uncommitted)
4. rebases the branch onto `upstream/main` and pushes it to your fork
5. opens the PR into upstream `main`, with `Closes #N` at the top of the body so the PR and the issue are linked
6. prints the PR link

After review comments, change the code and run it again: it commits, rebases and pushes to the same PR.

## 3. The whole flow by hand

This is what the scripts do, step by step.

1. **Sync `main`** with upstream:
   ```bash
   git switch main
   git fetch upstream
   git merge --ff-only upstream/main
   git push origin main
   ```
2. **Open an issue** (or pick an existing one) and comment that you're working on it:
   ```bash
   gh issue create -R VictorZakharov/last-stand
   ```
3. **Branch** off the fresh `main`, with the issue number in the name:
   ```bash
   git switch -c fix/issue-N
   ```
4. **Work and test.** Run `npm run dev` (http://localhost:5173) and play the change. Check small (1024×700) and large (1920×1080) viewports for UI changes. Before pushing:
   ```bash
   npm run build && npm run check:pages
   ```
5. **Commit and push** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "What the change does"
   git push -u origin fix/issue-N
   ```
6. **Open the PR** into upstream `main`:
   ```bash
   gh pr create -R VictorZakharov/last-stand --base main --head <you>:fix/issue-N \
     --title "What the PR does" --body "Closes #N

   What changed and how you tested it."
   ```
7. **Review.** Push fixes as new commits on the same branch. When upstream `main` moves on, rebase:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```
8. **After the merge**, sync `main` and delete the branch:
   ```bash
   git switch main
   git fetch upstream
   git merge --ff-only upstream/main
   git push origin main
   git branch -D fix/issue-N
   git push origin --delete fix/issue-N
   ```

## Rules and gotchas

- **Link the PR with `Closes #N` in its body.** A closing keyword in the title does nothing, and a PR never copies the issue text. With `Closes #N` in the body, the PR shows the issue under "Development", the issue shows the PR, and merging closes the issue.
- **Keep branches linear.** Rebase onto `upstream/main` and never merge `main` into your branch: the `branch-policy` check fails any PR that contains merge commits.
- **A branch must be up to date with `main` to merge.** The maintainer may update it with GitHub's "Update branch", which rebases the branch on your fork. Your local copy is then stale, so `git branch -d` refuses to delete it after the merge: use `-D`.
- **Fork PRs get a preview too.** A sticky comment links it at `https://victorzakharov.github.io/last-stand/pr-preview/pr-N/` once it's built. Still add screenshots for UI changes.
- **Every push waits for approval.** GitHub holds the workflow runs on a fork PR (checks and preview) until a maintainer approves them, for every push, not just your first PR.
- **Delete your fork's branch yourself.** Upstream deletes merged branches automatically only in its own repo.
- **One PR per feature.** Keep PRs focused.
