// A held weapon moving through a hero's fist by itself as he sits or stands (tools/lab `sit`). From play, of a maul he
// stood on its butt by a log: "maul cannot slide up without jedi force he doesn't have", and "maul slides up with jedi
// force, still". A fist may slide along a haft that stays where it is (its butt on the floor, his hand going up it),
// and a haft may slide through a loosened fist that another hand is moving; it may not move along itself through his
// right fist with no other hand on it. `HaftSlide` reads each frame the weapon's move in the world along its length,
// the right fist's slide along it, and whether his left fist is closed on it and moving with it (a left fist sliding
// along it too, kept by the right one, read as holding it, and the old jedi rise read 4 cm).
