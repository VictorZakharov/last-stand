// The shooters getting out of the hero's attacks (tools/lab `evade`): each foe that evades (`EnemyDef.evade`: the
// Sporecaller ducks into the ground, the Rift Witch blinks away) stood before the hero, held to its spot and kept from
// shooting, and each of his attacks it evades cast at it as the player casts it, try after try: from in front of it,
// where it sees the attack coming, from behind it, where it doesn't, and for a foe that ducks, at its feet as it's
// down. Each try's evade is caught as it's played (`Enemy.evade`), and each hit as it lands. From in front, about half
// the tries must be evaded (`chance`), none struck after it evaded, and every one it didn't evade struck (or the try
// measured nothing); a blink must end within its reach, clear of the props, the wall and the hero, a line it could
// walk from where it stood. From behind, none may be evaded and every one struck; at a ducked foe's feet, every shot
// must strike. (The owner's words: "the mushroom shooters should duck down to a mushroom with a 50% chance, so the
// shots will miss, unless fired under their feet"; "the wraiths will teleport to a near location with 50% chance,
// escaping the shot"; "dodge/duck should only work if player is in front of them... if another player shoots from
// behind, they cannot see that".)
