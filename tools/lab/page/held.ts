// preview shows in its own look with no countdown, and let go it casts; then held through its cooldown and short of
// energy (page/heldCooldown.ts): red, its seconds counting down, until a release would cast. Quarry Mark's preview
// outlines the foe it would mark in red (src/ui/overlay/outline.ts): in each of the game's views the outline must be
// drawn round that foe, its pixels near it on the screen and none away from it. Starfall's ring must be where its
// crystals surely strike, and every mark a preview lays on the floor must lie on it across the dais's step
// (page/heldArea.ts). No shader may compile meanwhile: every program a preview draws with is compiled at load (the
