// tools/lab `hall`: the hero in focus in the hall of heroes (src/game/hall.ts) showing off his skill and standing after
// it, frame by frame: each hand, elbow and the weapon's tip in his own frame, and where one of them jerks, its move a
// frame changing by more than `JERK_FROM` from the frame before (a jump, a stop or a start in a frame), or by more
// than `JERK_FLYING` while the weapon flies (a blow speeding down and coming to rest). From play: "warrior arms jerk in
// various poses after he finishes power strike, in char selection screen ... like an introvert on public speech".
// The hall's heroes are remote copies, posed from what their game reports, beside the lobby's own hero, hidden but
// still posed, so the lobby hero's measures (`range`) never saw them. The canary turns his right shoulder for a frame.
// Then the hall is opened again and left as his showcase is under way, and any sound it leaves playing is a problem
// (from play: "if mage was attacking in hall of heroes, going back to lobby keeps the attack sound"); its canary
// starts Void Lance's hum there and never stops it.
