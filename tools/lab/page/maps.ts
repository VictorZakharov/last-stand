// `lab maps`: the game's procedural maps (`PRELOAD` in src/core/pbr.ts), each made on the page as a worker makes it,
// timed by the browser's own clock, and a digest of its pixels (and of a face's grid, which its head is built on). A
// first visit makes every one before the lobby shows what it needs (30 s of the workers' CPU, the forest floor alone
// 5 s), so a map made faster must keep every pixel: with `--ab`, each digest matches main's, and the times are side
// by side. Each map a surface repeats must tile: its seams (page/mapSeams.ts) fail the command. Its means (the
// albedo's brightness, the roughness) show a new look's drift from main's, and `--pictures` shows each as a surface
// takes it (page/mapPictures.ts). `--canary` changes a byte of the first map's pixels after it's made (its digest
// must change) and plants a seam in a copy of it (it must be found).
