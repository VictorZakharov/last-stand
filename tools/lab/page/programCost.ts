// driver's), and timed from its source to its link: on Windows that is ANGLE turning it into HLSL and the D3D compiler
// making it, the CPU a first visit spends on it (a return finds it in the cache). One at a time, the time is the
// program's own, not shared with others compiling beside it. Summed by kind and by what uses the programs, the
// longest listed with their fragment shader's size and the point lights it is lit by (three writes the lights' loop
// out once a light). Its canary is the cache: the longest program compiled again with its salt must come back far
// sooner (the cache answering), and with a new salt as long as before.
