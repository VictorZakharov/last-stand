// `lab compiles`: whether the boot's warm-up compiled what a fight draws (tools/lab). The game compiles every program
// at boot (`game/warmup.ts`, `core/shaders.ts`), and one compiled mid-fight is a hitch of 10 to 30 ms, longer on a
// phone. In each biome the hero stands in the view asked for, and a prop of every kind the biome has (stone, wood,
// glowcap, embers) is broken in turn, its rubble, debris and smoke drawn as they fly and settle. Every program compiled
// meanwhile is a problem, said as the game's performance report says it (`lateCompiles`: what drew it and how its
// program differs from the nearest one compiled before). (#243's phone compiled a rubble program mid-fight: the empty
// pools were hidden after the first of the boot's warm-ups, so the lobby's warm-up in each biome, whose light makes
// programs of its own, drew none of them.) Each round counts the point lights each pass lights its materials with (the
// scene's, and through the eyes the arms', drawn by a camera of their own) against the boot's: a program is compiled
// for a count, and a pass drawn with another compiles all it draws again (#268: a hero built afresh, as a class switch
// builds him, had his light missing from the arms' pass). The first biome's wave is fought again by such a hero.
// `--canary` draws a material of a kind nothing else is before the hero, which must come out as compiled, and puts a
// light in the scene that the count must find.
