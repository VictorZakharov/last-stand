// Each skill's tooltip held to the hits it deals (tools/lab `tooltips`). The hero is given modifiers of every kind
// (all damage, arcane, elemental, a crit's chance and share, casting speed: his stats set, which the tooltip and the
// damage roll both read), each skill's tooltip is read as the player reads it, and the skill is cast at foes stood
// where it strikes (as `hits` casts it, a drawn shot at full draw). Every hit that lands must be within a figure the
// tooltip states per hit (a crit within it raised by the crit's share; down to the least share it says a hit of it
// can deal, and one of them at its full figure), a crit's chance must be the hero's, and a hit dealt over time must
// come as often as it says. First, the hotbar's tooltip is hovered, the weapon's all damage raised and the hero's
// stats made again from his gear, and hovered again: its figure must follow. Last, each skill whose tooltip states
// what it gives the hero (the draught's Health, Iron Bellow's ward) is cast: what it gave must be the figure. With the
// canary, all damage and the hero's most Health are raised once the tooltip is read, as a tooltip behind a change
// would be: the hits must be found above it, and what was given off it. (Issue #256: the tooltips showed the base
// damage alone, not what the hero deals.)
