// weapons his class has, cast at foes stood where it strikes (as `hits` casts it), every hit caught as the foe takes it
// and the log's list read back: each hit listed once and in turn, under the skill cast, on the foe it struck by its
// name, for what it dealt, of its type, a crit and a kill as they were. The basic attack is cast once more at foes it
// kills. Then a foe of each way of attacking (a blow, a bolt, a slam) comes at the hero, and each blow he takes is
// listed under the foe's name and its attack, for the life it took and what his shield and ward stopped. Each cast's
// lines are listed as the panel shows them, and the panel must show them all. (The owner, testing #255, a Bull Rush
// cast over a charging Power Strike: "there is 0 damage on dummies from bull rush itself". It had hit, its number
// shown a moment after Power Strike's.)
