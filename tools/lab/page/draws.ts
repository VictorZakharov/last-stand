// recorded: the pass it was in (the scene's, the shadow map's, the frame's post and overlays), the geometry and the
// material it drew. Its lists: the geometries drawn most often (one drawn many times a frame, a fern or a rock, is
// one an instanced mesh would draw once), the geometries that drew the most triangles (what the GPU's vertices cost),
// and the scene's draws by their material's look (draws of one look, a merge of what doesn't move would make one).
// And the triangles drawn for nothing: an instanced mesh's instances outside the view of the pass that drew them (the
// camera's, or the shadow map's box), as three.js culls an instanced mesh only whole, by the sphere round all of it.
// And the draws that drew nothing: an instanced mesh of no instances, a geometry of nothing in its range, each the
// renderer's work for a draw on the CPU. And through the eyes, what the arms' own camera drew (renderer.ts
// `drawArms`): the hero's arms and what they hold alone, anything else drawn over the frame at the arms' narrower view
// a problem (the crowds' bodies' own meshes were on the arms' layer, and a foe within reach was drawn huge over the
// frame). `--canary` stands seven boxes of one geometry before the hero, which must come out as seven draws of it,
// seven instanced boxes, four of them far behind the camera, which must come out as four drawn outside the view, an
// instanced mesh of none, which must come out as a draw of nothing, and through the eyes a box on the arms' layer
// before them, which must come out as drawn by the arms' camera though it isn't the hero's.
