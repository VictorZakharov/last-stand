// A skill's blows as they land (tools/lab `hits`): foes stand dazed where it strikes (as `death` stands them), living
// past every blow, and it is cast at them on a fresh set-up as the player casts it (held through for a channel, drawn
// to full for a drawn shot), `--than`'s skill held down for a row of its blows. Every hit is caught as it lands: its
// frame from the press, the foe and how much. A blow is the hits landing within a frame of each other (one cut
// striking three foes); each blow's time, the gaps between them, when the hero was free again and the damage a second
// till then are listed. Striking nothing, a gap past `--apart` and blows no quicker than `--than`'s are problems.
// (The owner's Twin Fangs, its two cuts 0.36 s apart: "too slow", "both hits in a rapid succession... maybe 0.2sec",
// "should be faster than regular LMB skill".)
