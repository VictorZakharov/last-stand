// What the slamming foes throw at a hero too far off to slam (tools/lab `throws`; `EnemyDef.throws`,
// src/entities/throws.ts): each thrower stood before the hero, held to its spot, its own AI throwing as the game plays
// it, a throw a case. The Cinder Brute's lava: stood still, the chunk must land where he stood as it left the hand, its
// ring there on the floor every frame it flies, its splash hurting him and its pool burning him after; stepped off
// as it's thrown, nothing may hurt him; up close, it slams and throws nothing. The Barkhide Hulk's vine: stood still,
// it must hold him for its `hold`, his walking going nowhere, and let him walk after; stepped aside as it's sent, it
// must never catch him; caught, a dash (Bull Rush, Veilstep) must tear him free. (The owner's words: "lava giants in
// crypt should throw lava chunks at player's location, at ballistic trajectory, if far from player", "a vine that
// sprawls on ground, ignoring obstacles in a straight line, that makes player bound to the ground for 1.5sec", "should
// be able to dodge while its being deployed".)
