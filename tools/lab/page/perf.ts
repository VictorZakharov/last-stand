// `lab perf`: skills cast in turn as the player casts them, the biome's foes coming at the hero, and every frame timed
// as the game's performance report times it (ui/perfHud.ts, on the browser's clock here: the page's stands still
// within a frame). Each frame is timed whole by the browser's clock, the game drawn and waited out on the GPU. Its
// update is split by stage, its render timed on the CPU, and the GPU timed by pass where the browser times it
// (EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2). Its draws, triangles and particles are counted. Each phase is summed apart:
// standing before the first press, then from each press to the next, the last one to the effects' end. Run it on a
// phone's screen, quality and CPU with `--screen 832x384@3.75 --quality low@518400 --throttle 4`. (The owner's report
// from a phone, #243: frames of 42 to 67 ms after Maelstrom and Glacial Nova, on a canvas of 3120x1440 with the scene
// drawn at 0.52 Mpx.)
