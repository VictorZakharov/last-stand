// tools/lab scenecost: what each kind of work in the scene pass takes of the GPU, at a quality level's settings and
// the screen's own pixels (the resolution is never what's cut: what each pixel costs is). The scene pass alone is
// drawn, with each part taken out and put back in turns (`gpuTurns.ts`), so a run's load falls on both sides: the
// point lights (and their lighting where they reach), their shadows, the sun's shadow, the environment, the lit
// shading against a plain colour, what's see-through or cut out, the particles, the hero. A laptop's integrated GPU
// spent 86% of its frame on the scene pass at 2864x1536 (10 frames a second on Medium): this says what of it a level
// could do without. Its canary draws the scene twice, which must read as more.
