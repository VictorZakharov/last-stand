// class aimed by holding (`SkillDef.aimed`: Veilstep, Starfall, Quarry Mark, Strawman), its button pressed by a
// finger as a touch screen sends it, the other thumb on the move stick. Tapped, a movement skill (Veilstep) goes the
// way the move stick points, or the way the hero faces while he stands, never at a foe; any other is cast at the
// nearest foe. Each is tapped standing, tapped down and up between two frames (a slow phone's quick tap) and tapped
// while he walks. Pressed and dragged while the stick is held and moved between the drag's stops, the skill's own
// preview (its ring and column of light, its area, the foe it outlines) shows where the drag points and follows it,
// and let go, it is cast where the preview last showed, the hero walking on. No tap may open a tooltip. On main a
// tapped Veilstep went at the nearest foe, landing the mage among the foes, a held skill showed a plain ring where it
// aimed, not its preview, and a tap's click opened the skill's tooltip pinned over the buttons.
