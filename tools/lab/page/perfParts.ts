// "low fps at night": the GPU at 12 ms of the frame, the phases' lines telling only scene and shadow. Its canary times
// the meadow drawn four times over, which must read as more than it does once. The hero is first turned all round: the
// report's GPU was 12 ms one way and 6 another, so the parts are timed turned the dearest way.
