// tools/lab fire: a biome's fire as the player meets it, and its flames measured as fire burns. The fire is found by
// its light (the warm one of the biome's ten point lights: a brazier's, a bonfire's) and read back from beside it
// three times a moment, with its own light (what it draws unlit near its light: flames and glows, and the glow
// particles), without it, and without the smoke too, so the differences are the fire alone and its smoke
// (fireMeasure.ts): how tall and wide it burns, its light
// and hue band by band from its base up (a wood fire burns yellow-white low and redder and dimmer as it rises), what
// of it is blown out white, the tongues its top breaks into, the smoke over it, how much of it moves from moment to
// moment and how its light swells (a fire a metre across puffs about 1.5 times a second); its light's flicker on the
// screen in the top-down view, as WCAG counts flashes. Its flames read alone from round it at one moment: seen from
// behind, a flame is its own mirror (its light passes through it), and one that shows the same face from either side
// turns with the camera. The plants reaching over it as the top-down view draws them (`fireClear.ts`). Pictured from
// beside it at three moments, its own light alone, from above, its flames from round it, and in the game's views
// with the hero standing before it.
