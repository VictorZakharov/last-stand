// `lab form`: the hero's run judged against a runner's (`runner.ts`), with each way he holds his weapons. He runs
// straight across open ground at full speed; each leg's frames are folded onto its own cycle, from its foot's
// touchdown to the next, the stance and the swing each stretched onto a runner's so the curves line up at the
// touchdown and the push off; and each joint's curve is set beside a runner's at that speed: the thighs, knees and
// ankles, the trunk's lean, the arms' swing and the elbows' bend, the stride's timing and the hips' bounce. A run is
// judged at a man's size: the hero's speed and lengths scaled by his legs against a man's (`MAN_LEG`). Each way is
// pictured at eight points of the stride: stick figures of his run over a runner's, the hero from the side, and the
// game's own views; measured first, then run again to picture the frames chosen.
