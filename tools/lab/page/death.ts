// Each skill's kills as the player sees them fall (tools/lab `death`). Foes stand dazed where the skill strikes, and
// it is cast at them twice on fresh set-ups: once with each foe a hair from death (the hit's damage nearly all past
// its life, so it is thrown hard) and once with each holding just under what the first cast dealt it (killed with
// little to spare, so it drops). Every fallen body is followed frame by frame, as drawn, until it has dissolved:
// how hard it was thrown and which way against the blow (away from the hero, along a sword's swing), how far it flew
// and how high, how long it took to lie still and how low it lay, and anything a body can't do: a part of it under
// the floor, inside a prop or past the arena's wall, its pose off its points, a number gone NaN. A storm's kills must
// go round it. The shaders compiled meanwhile must be none.
