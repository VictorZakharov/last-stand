// bands a metre wide: the grass's grain there (the light's step from a blade's pixel to the next blade's pixel beside
// it, against their light) and how it changed. A ring's cells are twice as wide as the one inside it, its blades a
// quarter as many and four times as wide, and where one handed over to the next the grass turned to a lighter, coarser
// carpet in a circle that followed the view (from play, "the circle of changing grass is still there, its about this
// far out, see where the far curb is, and it keeps moving as I'm moving"); the far rings' blades are cut into strands
// of the first ring's width now (`meadow.ts`). `canary` draws them whole, as they were.
