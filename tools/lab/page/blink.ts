// reach, at a prop, past a prop, out at the arena's edge, up onto the dais, at his own feet) it measures where the
// preview showed he'd come out against where he did, his reach, the props and the arena's edge there, how long it all
// took, his body coming apart and put together again, and a blow tried every frame: none may land while he crosses,
// and one must land once he is whole. Then held through its cooldown and short of energy (page/heldCooldown.ts): its
// preview red, counting the seconds down, until it would cast. Then foes near where he vanishes and foes further off:
// the near ones must stand dazed for their time, stars over their heads, and come on again after, and the far ones
// keep coming all along.
