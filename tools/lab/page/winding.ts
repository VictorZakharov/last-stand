// `lab winding`: which way the game's faces point (tools/lab). Every model (the heroes, the foes, the dummy) built
// afresh and every biome's props, each mesh split into its parts and each part judged by its signed volume
// (page/windingParts.ts): out, in, or open. A part wound inside out shows its inside wherever its material draws one
// side only: the forest's roots, `taperTube`s wound inwards, drew as black lines on the floor (#289). On a
// double-sided material three turns a back face's normal to the camera, which hides it, so those are listed apart
// and aren't problems. A mesh drawn by its back faces (a sky dome) is seen from inside on purpose and isn't judged.
// A mirrored mesh needs nothing of its own: three turns its front-face test round, so its geometry's winding decides.
// `--canary` plants a box wound inside out, one sided, in the first biome: it must be found.
