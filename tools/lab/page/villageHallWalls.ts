// `lab village`'s hall of heroes from above, wall by wall, each from play, each stand after the owner's picture:
//
// `hallWallsOneByOne`: a wall thins while it hides him or the floor near him, all of it, and no other does, its
// window's linings with it: "here we should not try to make transparent the side which doesn't help see the hero", "this wall
// should be transparent but the one 90 degree to it should not", "here both should be transparent, but only 1 is", "and
// here, should be transparent too", "this is good, but weird geometry on left". Places on each wall are read drawn as
// the game thins and with nothing thinned. `--canary`: every wall thinned at each stand, as it was.
//
// `roomColumnsStay`: in the doorway the room's columns he sees over the wall stay: "when entering hall, pillars inside
// disappear". A shaft shows if the frame changes with the columns hidden. `--canary`: they're hidden.
//
// `heroesSeenFromAbove`: from above the plinths' heroes stand while he can see a plinth: "pedestals are empty from this
// position, they should display heroes if character can see them from their cone of view". `--canary`: read as none.
//
// `objectsWalkedShort`: a clicked object is walked to by the shortest way into its reach: "when I click on campfire,
// hero moves in from the left side, it should be the shortest path". `--canary`: the shortest way read as half as long.
