// tools/lab swing: a swing through the eyes keyed from a pose (src/entities/viewSwing.ts). A pose is decided as a
// person holds it, the grip's place and the weapon's way as the eyes see them, and this gives the swing's key that
// holds it and what of it an arm swung in that swing's plane can't hold: the grip off the plane, the weapon's way off
// it, a wrist bent past its range, a grip past the arm's reach. Each key of the swing, or one given, is placed too: the
// grip, the weapon, the elbow and the wrist, and a two-hander's lower grip with how far it is from the other shoulder.
// (Keyed by its numbers alone, by trying them in a cast and reading the frames, a two-handed forehand took an hour of
// tries and its wind-up still put the lower grip 12 cm past the left arm's reach.) The canary keys the swing's blow
// from where its own key places it, which must come back as that key, and a grip moved 10 cm off the plane, which
// must be read 10 cm off. `--turn` turns it all with the trunk, as a cut turns it, and `--trunk` each key as far as
// the cut turns it at its share, to see a key as the eyes do (a two-handed cut's end read 64% in the frame by its key
// alone, and 0% as the eyes saw it turned 40 degrees left). Each of a swing's keys is placed in the plane the swing has
// at its share, a cut in a row's first ones in the plane it turns from (placed in its own, a backhand's first key read
// its lower grip 0.98 m from the left shoulder where the game drew it at the forehand's end, 0.39), and a cut taken on
// from another's end is placed at its start where that one left the arm, or said not to be. A two-hander's grips are
// measured from the hero's own shoulders, a held swing's (`ViewSwing.holds`) from those its guard puts, not the point
// its plane turns about. `all` steps every swing the hero's weapons are swung with as he holds them, each turned as
// the game turns it, so a check reads them all.
