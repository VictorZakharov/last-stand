// tools/lab's co-op (`npm run lab -- coop`): two games playing together, the host's in the side's page and the
// guest's in a partner page, their messages carried by the lab with the delay a link of the given ping and jitter
// gives them (tools/lab/node/coop.mjs). Each page's BroadcastChannel, which the game's `?net=local` link talks over, is
// replaced by one the lab carries, so the two games talk as they would through the relay server, every frame on the
// lab's clock. What each game shows is recorded frame by frame and judged against what the other one has: how late
// and how roughly a hero or a foe follows where its own game has it, whether an arrow that struck a foe on the guest's
// screen counted on the host, and whether a blow the guest dodged on its screen hurt it.
