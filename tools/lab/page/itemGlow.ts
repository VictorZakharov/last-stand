// tools/lab `glow`: a worn item's glow in its rarity's colour (#404, src/entities/models/itemGlow.ts), read back from
// the frame drawn as the player sees it, close up from his front and his back. The hero wears every item his class
// shows, in a player's colour (green by default: "green on green should work"); each slot's item is given the rarity
// alone, and the frame drawn with its glow and without (`ITEM_GLOW.strength` 0) at the same moment, so what it adds
// is its glow and nothing else (his gear set again between the two could seat his hands anew). From play: "slight
// glow, not much, no light source", "should not make it flat", "subtly animated (slowly)", "make sure glow is
// continuous/looped and not jumping". Then its tendrils over time, the hero held still and the glow's clock alone
// moved on: how far they move between samples, and the step as its cycle starts over against the steps beside it
// (a loop's is like the rest; a frame a cycle on against now can't tell, its shader given only the share of the
// cycle: that check passed a join the owner saw). Its canary makes the glow ten times as strong (too bright),
// nothing (unseen), and skips 2 s as the cycle starts over (a join).
