// The game's performance report as its overlay copies it (`perfReport` in src/ui/perfHud.ts), read by `lab perf`:
// its histories, a value for each of its 0.5 s buckets, and its long frames. The owner's lobby fell from 144 frames a
// second to 28 while hovering items, its frames late by 20 to 46 ms where ours took 11 to 18, and nothing in the
// report said whether the page's main thread or something outside it held them up: the long frames (Chrome's Long
// Animation Frames API) say what the thread did in each. A long task of the page's must be listed with what ran it.
// (It's run by a message: a click's long frame ends at the page's next rendering, which the lab's held frames put off
// past the report, where the owner's game renders every frame.)
