// tools/lab haze: what the hero's held weapons take from the frame round them through the eyes (lab haze). The frame
// is drawn as the player sees it, and again with the weapons hidden, each also with the grade's adaptation held off
// (core/renderer.ts `holdAdaptation`). Held off, the weapons change only their own pixels (themselves, their bloom,
// their shadows), which are left out. Anywhere else, a pixel the adaptation darkens more with the weapons shown than
// without them is darkened by their light: the eye's adaptation to a bright area spread out round them as a veil, its
// edges on the grid of areas it's measured over. (The owner, of the sword through the eyes: "weapons have a haze
// that darkens the area around them, I think it's a bug", "its pretty big", "when sword moves from left position
// (idle) back to right, haze moves too, but when its all the way left the haze is not there at all".)
//
// Their own pixels are parted into their surface (the `parts` look's) and their bloom. Held off, the share of their
// surface near white is glare, and the share of the frame past it their light brightens is its halo: the sun's
// highlight on a blade's flat held up by the eyes, blown out and bloomed round, its rougher grime left as dark blots
// across it (the owner, of each of a dual wielder's blades in the Thornwood: "this graphical issue seems lame",
// "right one too"). Seen through the adaptation, that blade was 0.6 of white and paled the hand under it.
//
// Any part of the hero can be measured so (`part`), in any view: the mage's glowing hand, its outline lit and a light
// of its own at the palm, blew out white over the back of it in third person (the owner: "his hands glows too
// bright", "we should never have blinding lights in our game").
