// `lab shadows`: the hero's shadow cast as one (src/entities/models/castAsOne.ts) against his pieces cast each on its
// own, as the player sees them. In each way he holds his weapons, in all his armour and in none (the gear's pieces
// shown and hidden, so the merged mesh made again), and in each view, the frame is drawn both ways and compared pixel
// by pixel. Cast as one, a piece's vertices pass through other matrices than its own (its bone's, in floats), which
// round otherwise: a shadow's edge moves by a texel here and there, and its soft edge differs by a few levels in up to
// some 250 pixels of the frame (the dual-wielder over the shoulder). More than that, or by more, is a fault: the
// merged mesh hidden for the frame it was made again lost 1.7k to 3.3k pixels of the shadow top-down by 56 to 133,
// and the body cast through the eyes 86k to 112k pixels by 38. The pieces cast as one are counted, so a frame with
// none cast that way can't pass for a match. `--canary` moves their shadow 30 cm: it must be seen. `--cost` times
// the shadow map's draw a frame by the browser's clock, the two ways in turns on the one page (the machine's load
// drifts from boot to boot), standing in the lobby's view.
