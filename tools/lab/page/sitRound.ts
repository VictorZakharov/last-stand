// tools/lab `sit --round`: E sits him on every seat from all round it. From play: "sit on stone no longer works at
// some angles, here press Sit, nothing happens, he runs up to the stone but does not sit". `lab sit` tries E from one
// side of one seat a kind; this sets him off from every side of every seat of its kind, points at it until it's
// outlined, presses E and follows him: sat whole, or where he stopped and why (his sit given up, got no nearer the
// spot he walks to, never let close enough to it).
