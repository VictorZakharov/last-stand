// `lab village`'s hero and the place round him behind what stands free, and what's built staying whole. From play, each
// a scenario here: behind the stair's cheek, behind the fountain and behind a lamp post, "character and context around
// character needs to be visible even if the character is behind props"; at a cottage's corner and by the hall's walls,
// "I should not able to see through walls like this".
//
// `heroBehindProps` reads how much of him shows: where he alone is drawn (all the village hidden) against the frame
// with him and without him. The prop must have hidden him with its hole shut (the state checked), must show him with it
// open, and must open round him. `--canary`: with the hole shut, too little of him must show in every scenario.
//
// `wallsStayWhole` draws the frame with the hole and without, at spots round a cottage's corners and along the hall's
// walls over the shoulder, and reads whether the near plane cuts a wall. `--canary`: what's built thinned as it was,
// the near plane left at 0.5 m.
