// tools/lab ui `sitHint`: the hint to sit (src/ui/sitHint.ts), "E Sit", shown while the cursor rests on a seat it
// has outlined (from play: "when pointing at object to sit on, we need to display a hint like E Sit"). The mouse is put
// over the lobby's seat nearest the hero for longer than `SIT.look`, as a player rests it there: the seat outlined,
// the hint shown and within the window; then put on the floor beside him, and the hint gone. The canary takes the
// shown hint off the page's view (hidden again), which must be caught as not shown.
