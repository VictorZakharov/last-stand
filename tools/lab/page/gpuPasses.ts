// post chain, the canvas's) named by what it draws and the size of what it draws into, its time the mean over the
// frames. Its canary is a render of its own, the scene drawn once more into a target of the frame's size and samples,
// which must be found, once a frame, and read at least `CANARY_LEAST`: a render
// missed, named as another or read 0 fails it. (Not against the scene's pass: on Very low that call writes 1.5
// timestamps a frame, drawn once a frame by its calls, and the scene drawn alone after the frame read 5.7 ms against
// its 20 there, the canary's own warm caches.)
