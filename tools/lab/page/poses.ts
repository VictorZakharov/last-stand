// tools/lab `poses`: the hero's pose frame by frame as a digest, and what his animation costs. He stands, walks,
// strafes attacking and stops, and after each frame every object of his model (its world matrix) and every point of
// the cloth and strings that move (a geometry's positions drawn as `DynamicDrawUsage`) is folded into a digest, to the
// last bit of each number; each move's digest is a line. So a change made to cost less is shown to pose him exactly as
// before by an A/B's digest lines agreeing (`--ab`), and its gain by the time lines beside them: his model's `animate`
// timed each frame by the browser's clock. A clip or range measure's lines agree for changes far past the last bit,
// and a gait's later strides go elsewhere after one bit (`check`'s offsets), so neither showed a speed-up kept the pose.
// The canary moves one number of the last frame by its last bit, and the digest must change.
