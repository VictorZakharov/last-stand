// `lab village`'s camera with a wall behind or beside him (from play, "being behind obstacle - this is not useful...
// I should see more"): over the shoulder, on the square, in the hall and on its portico, his back to what's built and
// then along it, a line from his chest to the camera must meet no wall of the village. Stood behind it, the wall
// dissolved in a small window round him and the rest of the frame was black. `canary` lets the boom stand behind
// what's built, as it did. Pulled in close, the camera must leave him whole and in the frame: stood at his shoulder a
// hand's breadth off, what it showed was a slice of his back, cut by the near plane (from play, "if you stopped moving
// cam through walls, you need to make sure it looks good at all angles"); the canary leaves it there too. Each spot
// the camera came close at is pictured, as no count says it looks good.
