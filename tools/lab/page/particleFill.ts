// scene's target, every layer counted. That is the fill a phone's GPU pays for them, which a desktop's GPU times don't
// show. The scale is the game's own (`uScale`, as the pool's material has it this frame): sized by the canvas's height
// while drawn into a scene of fewer pixels, #243's phone's particles were 3 times as wide as meant, 9 times the fill.
