// the shelves and ridges round it, the steps and colour where the head's own skin takes over from the neck's, its
// girth against a man's, skin come out through the clothes and the ground seen through between them from above
// (neckGaps.ts); its canaries planted (neckCanaries.ts); and pictured close in the studio from behind, the sides, the
// front and from above behind, as the game's camera looks down on him. (The owner, of the ranger from above behind,
// #261: "Fix neck sculpting, check all characters"; the column neck's flat top stood out of the head's skin under his
// ears, a ledge the light drew as a line across the back of his neck, and none of the face harness's neck numbers
// said so.)
