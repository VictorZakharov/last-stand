// The cursor drawn over mouse look while Alt is held (tools/lab `cursor`). In each close view the pointer is locked
// for mouse look as the player's click takes it (the lab's browser plays the lock: tools/lab/node/browser.mjs, every
// event of the mouse sent to the game's canvas while it's held, as Chrome sends them), and the mouse moved with
// nothing held must turn the view. Then Alt is held: the mouse moved onto the battle log's Pause (the view held still,
// the cursor drawn there, lit over a button), clicked (the log paused, no attack), moved onto a slot of the hotbar (its
// tooltip shown), its wheel turned over the log's lines (they scroll, the view keeps its zoom), and the world clicked
// (no attack). Alt let go, the cursor is gone and the mouse turns the view again; a click on the world attacks, which
// shows the measure sees an attack. The lock is held and the run goes on throughout. With the canary, Ctrl is held
// instead, a key that frees nothing: the checks must find the view turned, no cursor and the click on Pause attacking.
// (The owner, through the eyes: "in 3rd and 1st person user cannot press on those battle log buttons".)
