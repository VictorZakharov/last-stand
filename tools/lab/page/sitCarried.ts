// What a hero carries, followed as he sits down and gets up (tools/lab `sit`): every rigid mesh of his model (a
// weapon's, a shield's, the staff's, the bow's, the book's), read frame by frame as drawn. A mesh moved by the pose
// (not carried along by the bone it hangs from) must be in a hand while it moves, or lie still: from play, "staff
// dropping in a weird way" (the mage let go of it at a fifth of the way down and it went on to the floor on its own),
// "he just summons the bow into his hand using jedi force", "when warrior sits on a log, weapons are being pulled
// around with jedi force too, on sit down, and on stand up". A mesh turned or thrown further in a frame than a hand
// moves it is a jump. And what he holds is held as before once he's up again: "staff rotated when he stands up". A
// piece held is turned by the hand that holds it, not in it: "warrior magically rotates the sword in his hand" (the
// greatsword swung half round in his fist as he lowered it, 2 degrees a frame, under the jumps' limit), nor slid
// through it: "ranger uses force pull to grab his bow from seated near fire, when standing up". A palm resting on a
// piece's end (on a pommel, as a greatsword is stood under it) holds it to the floor, not in a grip: it turns under
// the palm as it's pushed upright, and isn't counted as turned in the hand; nor does an open hand, its fingers let
// go for the blade to swing round in it as a swordsman regrips (the game's `Model.fists`).
