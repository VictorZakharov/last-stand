// tools/lab in the game's page: the clock, the input, the set-ups and the pictures, so a measure is a few lines run on
// the game's own modules. They are imported as the game imports them (one copy of each module, never a stale one)
// and typechecked with the game, so a renamed joint breaks the build rather than a probe's numbers.
//
// The game's frames run on the lab's clock: each a hair over a 60th of a second, run as fast as the page can, nothing
// drawn unless asked (measures need no pixels; the scene's matrices are still updated, as a draw would). A set-up is
// checked once it's made and throws if it didn't take. A measure of a state that never happened reads as clean: a
// probe that scripted the game before its run began twice reported no clips at full draw, because it never drew.
