// tools/lab hood: the mage's hood against its reference, by numbers. Tuned by eye from pictures in the forest, one
// change to its cut reshaped the whole of it (a deeper face opening buckled the capelet, a wider dome turned the back
// to a blob) and four reviews in a row failed it. Here it's read two ways:
// - its outline in the studio from the front, his left and the back, laid over the reference's (its figure cut from
//   its plain backdrop), both on one grid in the face's own unit (the eye line to the chin, `E`, from marks on the
//   reference and the head's anatomy on ours): how much of the two outlines is shared, how high the hood stands over
//   the eyes and how wide or deep it is at the crown, the temples, the chin, the nape, the neck and the shoulders, its
//   fullness held to the reference's at the chin (from his left how far behind it hangs, and at the nape; from the
//   back how wide);
// - its shape on the head, from its cloth, against the sizes the reference was made to (its modelling notes): how far
//   its rim stands ahead of the brow and of the cheeks and out from the cheeks, how far its point rises above the
//   scalp and how far its capelet falls below the nape; and how much it changes shape as he walks;
// - its opening round the face from the front and his left (`hoodOpening.ts`): where its rim runs, how much of the
//   face it shows;
// - how its capelet lies on him (`hoodLie.ts`): how far it stands off his front, his shoulders and his back, and how
//   deep his body comes through the hood above it;
// - what its cloth costs a frame as he stands and walks (`HoodCloth.update`, by the browser's own clock).
