// the gate it came in by and the spot it rose on against the props and the arena's edge, the gates each group of foes
// and each wave came by, when the boss came against its wave's first group reaching the hero, and from each gate a
// boss's walk to the hero; then a few waves at the game's own pace (page/spawnPace.ts). A number of gates (one to
// four) no group came by, a wave that left a gate idle though its packs were enough for every gate, a gate no boss
// came by, a foe risen inside a prop (it rises in place, and once up is shoved out of the prop in a frame), a boss
// with or before its wave's first group or outside its time against it, and a gate from which the boss never reached
// the hero are problems (page/spawnGates.ts and page/spawnVerdicts.ts judge them). On main each group came by two
// gates picked at random, often one twice, every boss in the first group by one gate, anywhere 3 m to either side of
// its middle, and by the Thornwood's west gate foes and the boss rose in a log.
