// A command that runs its browsers in the lab's own process (`check`, `pwa`, one run without the server) stops when
// it's told to or when what started it is gone (tools/lab). On Windows a task stopped kills its own process and those
// Windows counts as its children, nothing else: an agent's check, stopped, ran on unseen for over an hour, eight
// browsers at full load, the machine's CPU and GPU pinned with every agent stopped. Under Git Bash, `npm run` leaves
// no line back to what started it (the shell that ran npm is gone as npm starts), so such a command notes itself in
// `out/running`, and `lab stop` asks it to stop; where the line is whole (a terminal, `node tools/lab/lab.mjs`, the
// server's supervisor), it stops too as soon as any process above it is gone.
