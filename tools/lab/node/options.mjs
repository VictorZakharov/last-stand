 * How an option's value is read:

 * - `text`: `--name value` or `--name=value`;
 * - `list`: comma-separated text, as a list (each one of `choices`, when it has them);
 * - `number`: a finite number;
 * - `pair`: two numbers, `x,z`;
 * - `numbers`: comma-separated numbers, as many as `count` says or in `each`s (any count without them),
 *   `0.2,-0.4,-0.5`;
 * - `choice`: one of `choices`;
 * - `ref`: a switch that may name a commit (`--ab`, `--ab=165246d`);
 * - `screen`: a window's size in css px and the screen's pixel ratio, `1280x720@3` (`@1` when it's left out);
